# Test description
#
#     This script tests that update-gitbar does not output nothing to stdout.
#      - running update-gitbar in PROMPT_COMMAND should obviously not produce
#        any output, even in case of error, as such output would be written
#        into the user's terminal before executing any command.
#
# How does this test works?
#
# - Set the PS1 env var to PROMPT so that it is easily identifiable.
# - run an *echo A* command on the terminal.
# - check the output produced on the terminal, it should only contain, in this
#   order:
#   - PROMPTecho A
#   - only CR or LF or ANSI escape sequences
#   - A (the one output by previous echo)
#   - only CR or LF or ANSI escape sequences
#   - PROMPT
# If this sequence is not matched that mean that some output has been produced
# and the text fails
